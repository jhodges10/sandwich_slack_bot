# sandwich_slack_bot

This readme doesn't have a ton of information in it for now.

Basically this new version of the slackbot is designed to split the listening part of the real-time-messaging Slack API into an asynchronous thread.

It doesn't quite work yet though...

On top of that - this should allow us to encode multiple clips at a time, save user preference for clips at 540 or 1080, answer simple questions from a CSV file using fuzzy matching and anything else we decide to add.
